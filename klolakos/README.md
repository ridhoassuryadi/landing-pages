## Introduction

## Features

- User authentication system with JWT
- Pre-configured Redux store with sample actions and reducers
- Basic routing setup using React Router
- SCSS for efficient styling
- Example API endpoints and database connections

## Prerequisites

Specify any prerequisites that users need to have installed or set up before they can use your starter template. This could include software, tools, or services. For example:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Git (optional but recommended)
