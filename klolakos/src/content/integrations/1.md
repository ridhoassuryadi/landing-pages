# How to Integrate Figma with Your App

Integrating Figma into your app can enhance your payment processing capabilities and offer a secure and convenient payment option for your users. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Visit the Figma Developer Site

Navigate to the [Figma Developer Site](https://developer.Figma.com/) and sign in with your Figma account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

## Step 2: Create a New App

Use the obtained API keys in your application to set up the Figma SDK. Figma provides SDKs for different programming languages and platforms, making it easier to integrate:

- For server-side implementations, select the SDK that matches your backend technology.
- For client-side integrations, such as web or mobile apps, use the Figma JavaScript SDK or mobile SDKs accordingly.

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

Figma offers a sandbox environment for you to test your integration without making real payments. Ensure to test all payment flows and scenarios to verify that everything works as expected.
