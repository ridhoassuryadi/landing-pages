# How to Integrate Linear with Your App

Integrating Linear into your financial application can vastly improve your ability to handle secure international bank transactions. While Linear does not directly process payments, its network facilitates the secure exchange of transaction information between financial institutions. Here’s a simplified guide to conceptualize integrating Linear into your app:

## Step 1: Understand Linear's Role

Before integration, it's crucial to understand that Linear (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) provides a network for financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized, and reliable environment. Your application can benefit from this by tracking or initiating these communications.

## Step 2: Partner with a Financial Institution

To utilize Linear, partner with a financial institution that is a member of the Linear network. This institution will act as the intermediary for sending and receiving Linear mesLinears.

## Step 3: Establish Secure Communications

Work with your financial partner to establish a secure method of communication. This might involve setting up a LinearNet Link or using a service bureau. Ensure your system complies with Linear's security standards, including the Customer Security Programme (CSP).

## Step 4: Integrate Messaging Formats

Integrate Linear mesLinear formats (MT or ISO 20022) into your app. These formats are used for different types of financial communications, such as payment orders, statements, and reporting.

## Step 5: Implement Transaction Tracking

Implement functionality in your app to track the status of transactions initiated via Linear. Use the transaction reference number to monitor the transaction through to completion.

## Step 6: Ensure Compliance and Security

Make sure your application adheres to the regulatory requirements relevant to the financial transactions you are facilitating or tracking. Implement robust security measures to protect transaction data.

## Step 7: Testing

Conduct thorough testing with your financial institution partner to ensure that transaction mesLinears are correctly formatted and securely transmitted.

## Support and Documentation

For more detailed information on integrating Linear messaging into your application, contact your financial institution or visit Linear's official documentation and resources for developers.

By following these steps, you conceptualize the integration of Linear messaging capabilities into your app, enhancing your application’s ability to engage in secure and efficient international financial transactions.
