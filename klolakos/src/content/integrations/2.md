# How to Integrate Github with Your App

Integrating Github into your application empowers you to process payments securely and efficiently, enhancing your service offering and customer experience. Follow these steps to integrate Github's powerful payment processing capabilities into your app:

## Step 1: Sign Up for a Github Account

Visit the [Github website](https://Github.com) and sign up for an account. Complete the registration process to gain access to the Github Dashboard, where you can manage your Github integration settings.

## Step 2: Access the Github API

After setting up your account, navigate to the Developers section in your Github Dashboard. Here, you'll find your API keys (publishable key and secret key), essential for integrating Github with your app.

## Step 3: Install the Github SDK

Github provides SDKs for various programming languages and platforms, making it easier to integrate:

- For web applications, use the Github.js library and the Github Elements package for building custom payment forms.
- For mobile apps, Github offers SDKs for iOS and Android, allowing you to incorporate Github's payment processing features directly into your native apps.

## Step 4: Implement Github API into Your App

With the Github SDK installed, use the API keys to authenticate your requests to Github. Implement the necessary API calls to handle payment processing, such as creating charges, managing subscriptions, and handling customer information securely.

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

Utilize Github's test environment to safely simulate payment transactions without processing actual payments. This step is crucial for ensuring your integration works as expected under various scenarios.

- Github provides test API keys and test card numbers to facilitate thorough testing.

## Step 6: Go Live

Once you're confident with your integration's functionality and security, switch to your live API keys in the Github Dashboard. Start processing real payments and monitor transactions through the Dashboard.
