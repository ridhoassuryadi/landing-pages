      # My Story

      Hi! 👋 My name is Paul Koeck and I am a young full-stack web & app developer from Austria. Here's a brief journey through my coding adventure and the milestones along the way.

      ## The Spark of Interest

      When I was just 12 years old, my brother [Simon Koeck](https://simon.koeck.dev) introduced me to the world of coding at the [Code Base Camp](https://www.code-base.at/!). There, I wrote my first line of code, delving into HTML & CSS. Although I took a brief hiatus from coding to immerse myself in video games, one game, [Welcome to the Game II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/720250/Welcome_to_the_Game_II/!), reignited my passion. Inspired by its hacking theme, I decided to create a similar game. My dedication led me to complete the project during a [Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/cr4ck-launcher!), despite the steep learning curve with C# and Unity.

      [![Crack Launcher](/screenshots/crack.png)](#crack)

      ## From Games to Apps

      My journey didn't stop at game development. The next venture was [Frags](#frags), a mobile app designed to extend keyboard functionality through custom macro keys. Transitioning from Unity to Dart and Flutter, I dedicated countless hours to this project. The app's popularity soared unexpectedly, thanks to a feature by [Cinecom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4ySShjYdeQ!) on YouTube, leading to over **15,000 downloads**.

      [![Frags](/screenshots/frags.png)](#frags)

      ## Diving into Freelancing

      Encouraged by my initial projects, I ventured into freelancing on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/paulkoeck) in 2021. My first client was [TraderEdge](#traderedge), marking my deep dive into web development. Although we planned to launch [FoxFunding](#foxfunding-archive), the success of TraderEdge shifted our focus, and FoxFunding was archived [here](#foxfunding-archive). Around this time, I also embarked on creating a desktop app for [Live! Casino Hotel Maryland](https://maryland.livecasinohotel.com/!), which turned into a series of seven successful desktop app projects for the casino.

      ## Expanding My Horizon

      Between 2021 and 2022, I undertook numerous freelance projects, maintaining an average of 4.9 stars over 16 reviews on Fiverr. My last freelance project was [Spaceping](#spaceping), a testament to my growing expertise and creativity in app development.

      [![Spaceping](/screenshots/spaceping.png)](#spaceping)

      ## Personal Projects

      My journey didn't stop with freelance work. I've since launched significant personal projects like [Remark](#remark), [KeyTap](#keytap), and [Refery](#refery), alongside smaller side projects which you can find in the [projects folder](#projects).

              # About

              I once read an insightful piece that highlighted how people are 90% more likely to purchase a product or service if it comes recommended by a friend. This statistic sparked an innovative idea in my mind, leading to the creation of "Refery." The concept was simple yet revolutionary: Why not reward individuals for sharing advertisements?

              ## Existing Strategies

              The realm of marketing has long been familiar with influencer, affiliate, and referral marketing strategies. However, Refery was set to stand apart from these traditional approaches.

              ### Influencer Marketing

              Influencer Marketing capitalizes on the trust we place in our idols. Nonetheless, it predominantly targets celebrities or individuals with massive followings, overlooking the average person. But whom do we trust more than anyone? Precisely, our friends and family. This is where Refery bridges the gap, making every individual a potential influencer within their own circle.

              ### Affiliate Marketing

              Affiliate Marketing, on the other hand, demands considerable effort from affiliates. It often involves setting up intricate online stores and reselling products, resembling more of a side hustle. Refery simplifies this process, requiring just a few clicks to share and earn, eliminating the need for extensive setups.

              ### Referral Marketing

              Referral Marketing comes closest to the essence of Refery, thus inspiring its name. However, traditional referral programs typically offer rewards such as discounts, platform credits, or free subscriptions rather than real money. Additionally, these campaigns are confined to the company's existing customer base, limiting their reach. Refery innovates by offering real monetary rewards and opening up the campaigns to a broader audience.

              ### Commissions

              One significant advantage for companies partnering with Refery is the versatility in commission offerings. Unlike traditional models restricted to purchase-based commissions, Refery allows for commissions on a wide array of actions, including downloads, survey completions, sign-ups, and more.

              ## Result

              Motivated by this idea, I dedicated over 400 hours across approximately six months to develop Refery. The project has since grown into a substantial codebase, amassing over 30,000 lines of code. It stands as one of my most significant and challenging projects to date, embodying a unique blend of innovation, simplicity, and inclusivity in the digital marketing landscape.

              ## The Spark of Innovation

              I've always been deeply passionate about boosting productivity and enhancing the speed of my work. This drive led me to switch from Visual Studio Code to Vim a few years ago. Vim, known for its plethora of keyboard shortcuts, was an eye-opener for me. I marveled at how these shortcuts could significantly streamline my workflow, making me a staunch advocate for Vim. The only drawback? The steep learning curve associated with mastering these shortcuts, which I found frustratingly time-consuming.

              ## The Birth of KeyTap

              It was this blend of admiration and frustration that sparked the idea for **KeyTap**. I envisioned KeyTap as an interactive tool to demystify the world of keyboard shortcuts, making them accessible and easier to learn for everyone. Driven by this vision, I dedicated approximately six months to coding KeyTap from the ground up.

              ## Achievements and Milestones

              After countless hours of coding, KeyTap evolved into a comprehensive platform boasting over 15,000 lines of code. It now supports 21 different applications, encompasses 199 meticulously crafted lessons, and introduces users to over 3,000 keyboard shortcuts. Our proudest achievement to date? Teaching our users a staggering 3,200 shortcuts, empowering them to work more efficiently and effectively.

              ## Looking Forward

              KeyTap's journey from a simple idea to a robust platform is a testament to the power of innovation and perseverance. As we continue to expand our lessons and support for more applications, our mission remains the same: to make productivity tools like keyboard shortcuts universally accessible and easy to master. Join us on this journey to unlock your full potential and transform the way you work.

              # About

              Once, after sharing my thoughts under a YouTube video, I encountered a challenging situation. The channel owner, holding a different opinion, decided to delete my comments. Persistent attempts to repost were futile; my comments were consistently removed, and some of my words even ended up on the channel's comment filter blacklist.

              Frustrated by this restriction on free speech, I was compelled to find a solution. It dawned on me that a browser extension could elegantly address this issue by creating an independent comment system. This system would store comments in a separate database, inaccessible even to website owners. But as I delved deeper, I realized the benefits extended far beyond just uncensored speech.

              ## Uncensored

              The cornerstone of Remark is its commitment to free speech. Comments posted using Remark remain untouched, unless they violate our terms of service by being racist or similarly offensive. This foundational principle ensures that everyone's voice can be heard.

              ## Better

              Remark isn't just about uncensoring; it enhances the commenting experience. With features like replies, mentions, upvotes, and downvotes, it brings a rich, interactive dynamic to online discussions. Our voting system ensures that the most valuable comments rise to the top, fostering a community-driven approach to content curation.

              ## Anywhere

              Remark redefines the boundaries of commenting. It empowers users to leave comments on any site, regardless of whether it has its own comment system. This universal capability, paired with the convenience of a single account for all interactions, opens new avenues for online engagement.


              ## Results

              Remark has grown to over 10,000 lines of code, becoming one of my most cherished projects. It supports nearly all common browsers, embodying my vision of a more open and interactive internet.

              This journey from a frustrating encounter on YouTube to the creation of Remark underscores my dedication to free speech and innovation. It's a testament to the power of technology in overcoming barriers and bringing people together, one comment at a time.

              ## The Beginning
              Like every other developer out there, I needed a portfolio website. I first had the idea of making my portfolio in the style of a Terminal, which I then also did. The concept was simple yet intriguing, providing a unique experience for anyone visiting my site. You can go check it out [here](#terminal) if you're interested. After launching, I received pretty good feedback from a few people. Having the site online for around a year gave me a lot of insights and experiences.

              ## Seeking Innovation
              However, as time passed, the desire for innovation grew within me. I yearned for something new, something that would not only capture the essence of my initial idea but expand it into an even more immersive experience. That's when the idea struck me - why not create not just a "fake" terminal but an entire operating system? The thought was ambitious, and I knew it would be a challenge unlike any I had faced before.

              I embarked on this ambitious project, which I named PortfolioOS, about two years ago. It was a venture into uncharted territory, an attempt to blend the boundaries between a portfolio and an interactive user experience. However, life and other projects demanded my attention, and I reluctantly had to pause the development of PortfolioOS.

              ## A New Dawn
              Fast forward to 2024, a year of new beginnings and renewed determination. I finally took up the project again, pouring my passion and creativity into making PortfolioOS not just a reality, but an experience that would stand out. The development process was intense, filled with learning and overcoming obstacles. Just before I was about to finalize the project, curiosity led me to explore whether anyone else had embarked on a similar journey.

              That's when I discovered [Dustin Brett's Portfolio](https://dustinbrett.com/). His project was nothing short of incredible, a testament to creativity and technical skill. It was more fascinating than anything I had envisioned. However, instead of viewing this discovery as a setback, I saw it as a source of inspiration. It reinforced my belief that unique ideas exist to be explored and that PortfolioOS had its own value and charm.

              ## Looking Ahead
              Despite the existence of similar projects, I believe there is always room for innovation and personal expression. PortfolioOS is a testament to that belief. It's not just a portfolio; it's a journey, an experience that I've created for anyone who wishes to explore my work and creativity in a novel way.

              I'm also considering offering PortfolioOS as a website template. It's completely configurable by one config file, making it easily adaptable for others who wish to share their journey in a unique and interactive manner. If you're interested in making your portfolio stand out, just hit me up [here](#contact)!

              PortfolioOS is more than just a project; it's a reflection of my journey as a developer and a creator. It's a reminder that innovation and creativity have no bounds, and that sometimes, looking back at where we started can inspire us to push even further.

              ## The Unexpected Opportunity

              One day, out of the blue, I received a message on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/paulkoeck), from someone asking if I was available to join their team as a developer. Curiosity piqued, we quickly scheduled a meeting. Little did I know, this meeting would mark the beginning of an extraordinary journey. As I hopped onto the call, I was introduced to [Ortwin Kartmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartmann/!), the founder of [Sofort](https://sofort.com/!). To say I was a bit taken aback would be an understatement.

              ## A Vision Beyond Earth

              During our conversation, Ortwin unveiled his visionary project idea - to collect stories from 1,000,000 people, compile them, and send them to space aboard a rocket! Had I not been aware of who Ortwin was, I might have dismissed the idea as fanciful. However, knowing his background, I was instantly captivated by the concept and eager to be part of this ambitious endeavor.

              ## The Sprint to Launch

              Embracing the challenge, we were faced with a daunting task: to bring this project, dubbed Spaceping, from concept to launch in merely two months. The workload was immense, but fueled by our collective enthusiasm and commitment, we dove headfirst into the development process. About a week into our journey at Spaceping, I introduced my brother, [Simon Koeck](https://simon.koeck.dev), to Ortwin. Impressed by the project's scope and potential, Simon too joined our team, further bolstering our development efforts.

              ## Achieving Milestones and Beyond

              Miraculously, we met our ambitious deadline, releasing Spaceping to the world on time. Over the following months, our team continued to refine the platform, squashing bugs and rolling out new features to enhance the user experience. Eventually, we reached a point where we considered the website to be "good enough for now," recognizing the need to shift our focus towards marketing to propel Spaceping towards its full potential.

              ## Looking to the Future

              The journey with Spaceping has been nothing short of a rollercoaster - challenging, exhilarating, and profoundly rewarding. As we pivot towards expanding our reach and capturing the imagination of millions, I remain incredibly excited to witness the evolution of Spaceping. The dream of sending a rocket filled with human stories into the cosmos is bold, ambitious, and a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation. Here's to reaching for the stars and beyond!

              ## The Beginning

              One day, while browsing through my Fiverr messages, I received a new project request. This wasn't just any project; it was for the "Architekturbüro Böller", a renowned architecture firm based in Switzerland. The client needed a modern, efficient, and easily manageable website that could showcase their architectural projects in the best light possible.

              ## Choosing the Stack

              To meet the client's needs, I decided to use Next.js with TailwindCSS for the frontend. This combination allowed me to create a sleek, responsive design that adapts to any device, ensuring the website would look great whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities would also improve the website's SEO, making it easier for potential clients to find "Architekturbüro Böller" online.

              ## The CMS Magic

              For the content management system (CMS), I chose Strapi. This headless CMS enabled me to make the entire website fully configurable without the need for additional coding.

              # Concept

              ## Introduction
              Crax is an innovative concept developed to address a common oversight in the usage of combination locks. Many individuals tend to alter only a few digits of their combination, believing this small change suffices for security. Crax capitalizes on this behavior by meticulously tracking failed attempts to unlock, leveraging mathematical algorithms to predict the actual combination. This approach demonstrates a significant improvement in guessing the correct pin over time, offering a fascinating insight into human habits and security practices.

              ## How It Works

              ### Tracking Invalid Pins
              The core functionality of Crax revolves around the systematic recording of invalid pin entries on combination locks. This process involves observing and documenting each failed attempt to unlock, providing a dataset from which patterns can emerge.

              ### Mathematical Analysis
              With a comprehensive collection of incorrect pins, Crax applies a series of mathematical algorithms designed to analyze these entries. The algorithms consider factors such as the frequency of specific digit changes. 

              ### Predictive Accuracy
              As the volume of tracked data increases, Crax's ability to accurately predict the correct pin improves. This efficiency highlights the concept's potential in understanding and exploiting human tendencies in setting and changing lock combinations.

              ## Ethical Considerations
              It is imperative to recognize that Crax, while innovative, must be approached with strict ethical considerations. The concept is intended solely for educational purposes or for use on personal combination locks. Utilizing Crax on locks owned by others without their explicit consent constitutes a violation of privacy and legal boundaries, potentially leading to criminal charges.

              ## Conclusion
              Crax presents a novel approach to understanding and predicting combination lock pins, underlining the importance of robust security practices. By shedding light on common vulnerabilities in lock usage, it encourages individuals to adopt more secure habits in setting their combinations. However, its application must be governed by ethical standards, emphasizing respect for privacy and legality.

              ## The Idea Behind Uniquer

              Uniquer is a revolutionary concept designed to optimize file management and storage efficiency. The core idea is simple yet powerful: save equal files only once and avoid duplicates. This approach is not just about saving space—it's about creating a smarter, more efficient way to handle files on your system.

              Implemented in just a single line of code, Uniquer brings a seamless experience to managing files, ensuring that each file is unique, thus eliminating the need for duplicate copies. This straightforward strategy offers multiple benefits, making file management a breeze while enhancing your system's performance.

              ## Advantages of Using Uniquer

              - 📦 **Save Storage**: By ensuring no duplicates are saved, Uniquer significantly increases available storage space, allowing you to make the most out of your device's capacity.

              - 💻 **Save Performance**: Uniquer optimizes performance by writing a file only if it doesn't already exist, reducing unnecessary write operations on your storage media.

              - 📁 **Get Unique File Names**: Forget about spending time thinking up new file names to avoid duplication. Uniquer automatically generates a unique file name for each set of data, simplifying file management.

              - 🧹 **Keep It Clean**: A clean file system is a happy file system. With no duplicates and fewer files to manage, your directories stay organized and clutter-free.

              ## How It Works

              Uniquer employs a straightforward yet effective mechanism to ensure file uniqueness:

              1. Create the SHA256 hash of the passed data, ensuring a unique identifier for each file content.
              2. Generate the file name by appending the appropriate file extension to the hash.
              3. Before creating a new file, check if a file with the generated name already exists.
                 - If not, the file is created.
                 - If yes, no action is taken, avoiding duplicate file creation.

              This process guarantees that for any given set of data, only one file is created and stored. If you attempt to write the same data multiple times, Uniquer will:

              - Write the data only once.
              - Create only a single file.

              With SHA256 hash function's reliability, there's no need to worry about duplicate file names. The chances of a hash collision are astronomically low, ensuring that each file name is as unique as the data it represents.

              ## Collision-Free Assurance

              The uniqueness offered by Uniquer is backed by the robust SHA256 hashing algorithm, which has never encountered a collision. This means that every piece of data processed by Uniquer is guaranteed to have a distinct file name, ensuring the utmost efficiency in file management and storage.

              Uniquer is not just a tool; it's a new way of thinking about how we store and manage files, ensuring efficiency, cleanliness, and uniqueness at every step of the way.

              ## Funding for Traders

              FoxFunding was an ambitious project designed to offer traders the opportunity to trade with our capital and keep the profits. The idea was to create a platform where traders, regardless of their background or financial capacity, could access significant trading funds. This initiative aimed to democratize trading by removing the financial barriers that prevent talented traders from scaling their strategies.

              ### The Journey

              As outlined in the [About Me](#about) section, FoxFunding was a project that I embarked on early in my web development career. It represented a pivotal moment where I began to blend my passion for finance with my growing skills in web development. The concept was simple yet powerful: empower traders by providing them with the capital needed to execute their trades and allow them to retain the profits.

              ### Shift in Focus

              While FoxFunding was a project close to my heart, the unexpected success of another venture, [TraderEdge](#traderedge), led to a shift in focus. TraderEdge's growth and potential demanded more attention, leading to the difficult decision to archive FoxFunding. This decision was not made lightly, but it was necessary to allocate resources where they could be most effective. The archive of FoxFunding can be found [here](#foxfunding-archive).

              ### Lessons Learned

              Despite the project not reaching its full potential, the experience of building FoxFunding was invaluable. It was during this time that I honed my skills in web development, learned about the intricacies of the financial market, and understood the importance of pivot when necessary. FoxFunding might not have become what we envisioned initially, but it played a crucial role in my growth as a developer and an entrepreneur.

              ### Reflections

              Looking back, FoxFunding was more than just a project; it was a learning curve. It taught me resilience, the importance of adaptability, and the value of pursuing your passions. While it might be archived, the lessons learned and the experiences gained will forever influence my journey in the tech and financial worlds.

              In the end, every line of code contributed to my development and every strategy session enriched my understanding of the market. FoxFunding may have been archived, but its impact remains a significant chapter in my journey.

          Our website is hosted on Vercel, which provides us with the online platform that allows us to present our content to you. Your data may be stored through Vercel's data storage, databases, and general applications. They store your data on secure servers behind a firewall.

          ## Data Sharing and Disclosure

          We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners and trusted affiliates for the purposes outlined above.

          ## Your Rights

          You have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal information we hold about you. If you would like to exercise these rights, please contact us at [ulunmuhammadridho@gmail.com](mailto:ulunmuhammadridho@gmail.com).

          ## Changes to This Privacy Policy

          We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

          ## Analytics 

          For web analytics, we use Pirsch Analytics. Pirsch Analytics is a cookie-free web analytics software that was developed according to the Privacy by Design principle. To analyze visitor flows, Pirsch Analytics uses a hashing algorithm to generate a 16-digit number as the visitor ID when the page request is received. The input values are the IP address, the user agent, the date and a salt.

          The visitor's IP address is not persisted in whole or in part, and is anonymized completely and non-reversibly by the hash. The inclusion of the date and the use of one salt per website ensures that website visitors cannot be recognized for more than 24 hours and cannot be tracked across multiple websites. A rough localization (country/city) is performed via a locally integrated database.
